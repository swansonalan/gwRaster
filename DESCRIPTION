Description: Contains a number of functions for fitting a GWR, plotting it's errors, producing fits, plotting those fits, etc.
    Typical process would be to:
    1. Fit a model to tabular data using gwr_loocv().  This fits the gwr to a set of points defined by the 'idx' argument.  It outputs a 'gwr' object 
    containing the formula, cofficients at each evaluation point.  The plot() method for this makes a set of diagnostic plots.
    2. Estimate coefficients over a grid using gwr_coef_map(), using a 'gwr' fit from (1) as the main argument.  Main additional argument is a raster 
    template defining the grid over which to make estimates.  By default, these outputs go into a 'gwr_coefs' subfolder of the directory containing the tmplt file.  
    Outputs get named based on the formula converted to text and the bandwidth.  Generates a 'gwr.coef.fit' object containing the orignal 'gwr' fit and file locations.  
    3. Make maps using the coefficients from (2) using gwr_fit_map().  The main argument is a 'gwr.coef.fit' object, along with a named vector of raster filenames.  
    Works great with     pre-made sets of predictor rasters covering smaller subsets of a large region.  By default, outputs go into a subfolder of the directory 
    of the input rasters name 'gwr_fits', using the same 'name' generated in (2).  Returns a 'gwr.raster.fit' object containing the 'gwr.coef.fit' filenames and stats. 
    4. Use pan_sharpen() to combine a more accurate coarse-res fit with a more precise high-res fit.  Main arguments are the two 'gwr.raster.fit' objects.  Output will 
    be given a name combining the two and go into the same directory.
