\description{
This function is for pan-sharpening a more accurate coarse grid using finer, but possibly biased, estimate of the same thing.
Based on ratio compnenent substitucion (RCS) pan-sharpening following

Steps:
1. resample the coarse image to the fine resolution
2. resample the fine image to the coarse resolution
3. resample the coarse version of the fine back to fine res.
4. compute ratio of the original fine imag to it's smoothed version (3)
5. multiply (1) by (4)
